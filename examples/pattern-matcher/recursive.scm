; recursive.scm -- A recursive chain of queries.
;
; This demo illustrates how recursive queries can be written. It shows
; a very simple kind of forward chaining, made possible by sequencing
; primitive operations together in sequential execution.
;
(use-modules (opencog) (opencog exec))

; ----------
; Populate the AtomSpace with a tiny fragment of an upper ontology.
; The demo will be chaining these together, to reach conclusions
; about relationships.

(Inheritance (Concept "living thing") (Concept "physical thing"))
(Inheritance (Concept "animal") (Concept "living thing"))

; ----------
; Define a very simple is-a relationship. It defines a predicate that
; takes two arguments: "this" and "that", and looks to see if the two
; inherit from each other. When evaluated, it will return true if the
; AtomSpace contains an InheritanceLink connecting "this" and "that".
; It explicitly checks for the presence of such a link, with the
; PresentLink.
(Define
	(DefinedPredicate "simple is-a relation")
	(Lambda
		(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
		(Present (Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that")))))

; Lets check if mammals are vertebrates. This should return the true
; TV, i.e. (SimpleTruthValue 1 1)  aka (stv 1 1)
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "simple is-a relation")
		(List	(Concept "mammal") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; The same query also works without the intervening Define; one can
; stick the Lambda directly into place in the EvaluationLink.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(Lambda
			(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
			(Present (Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))))
		(List	(Concept "mammal") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; ----------
; Here's what we cannot do, or rather, should not do: we should not
; directly assert that
;    (Present (Inheritance  (Concept "foo") (Concept "vertebrate")))
; because doing so would have the side-effect of inserting the
; relationship between "foo" and vertbrates directly into the AtomSpace.
; This is why the above structures are fairly complex: they are using
; variables to avoid accidentally asserting new relationships into the
; AtomSpace. When the cog-evaluate! runs, it of course subsitutes
; (beta-reduces) the Concepts into the Variables, and then evaluates
; the result. But the evaluation is done in such a manner that the
; AtomSpace is not polluted with InheritanceLinks between things that
; don't belong.
;
; For example, below, we check for nonsense, for a "foobar" relation.
; That comes out false, and the contents of the AtomSpace are not
; corrupted in the process.
; ----------

; We can verify that nonsense returns false aka (stv 0 1).
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "simple is-a relation")
		(List	(Concept "foobar") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; There is an explicit AbsentLink, as well. It's the opposite of the
; PresentLink.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(Lambda
			(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
			(Absent (Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))))
		(List	(Concept "foobar") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; Of course, we could have said "not present"; the AbsentLink is not
; really needed for this demo; it is far more useful and powerful
; when it appears in patterns.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(Lambda
			(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
			(Not (Absent (Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that")))))
		(List	(Concept "mammal") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; ----------
; Verifying a grand-parent/grand-child relationship requires moving to a
; different syntax. The query below requests that something in the
; middle is present in the AtomSpace.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Satisfaction
		(Present
			(Inheritance (Concept "human") (Variable "middle"))
			(Inheritance (Variable "middle") (Concept "vertebrate")))))

; The above works fine, and is resonably readable. The only problem
; is that the two constants appear in the middle of the expression.
; These can be pulled out with a Lambda. It is a bit verbose, but
; it allows a generic predicate to be defined.
(Define
	(DefinedPredicate "grandparent relation")
	(Lambda
		(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
		(Satisfaction
			(Variable "middle")
			(Present
				(Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "middle"))
				(Inheritance (Variable "middle") (Variable "that"))))))

; Thise new predicate can be used exactly the same way as the earlier
; one.  All the intervening details have been hidden.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "grandparent relation")
		(List	(Concept "foobar") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; We can check that it indeed "skips a step" correctly.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "grandparent relation")
		(List	(Concept "human") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; ----------
; What about the general recursive case? This is sadly rathr verbose,
; but here it is. To unpack it verbally:
; 1) Start with a definition: the name of the recursive function.
; 2) The lambda: it binds two variables, as before.
; 3) A SequentialOr. Evaluation stops as soon as one of the terms
;    returns true.
; 4) A direct check of inheritance. If this evaluates to true, then
;    we are done.
; 5) If not, then a SatisfactionLink, much as before.
; 6) The SatisfactionLink is looking to see if "this" is connected
;    to the middle.
; 7) But we also need the middle connected to a recursively long
;    chain. To get that, we refer to the recursive definition itself.
;    That defintion takes two arguments. But which two arguments?
;    The PutLink explains exactly which two: the middle, and the
;    other endpoint.
;
(Define
	(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")                 ;; Step 1)
	(Lambda
		(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))   ;; Step 2)
		(SequentialOr                                        ;; Step 3)
			(Present
				(Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))) ;; Step 4)
			(Satisfaction
				(Variable "middle")                            ;; Step 5)
				(And
					(Present                                    ;; Step 6)
						(Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "middle")))
					(Put                                        ;; Step 7)
						(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")
						(List (Variable "middle") (Variable "that"))))))))

; Let's test it out. Does it work?
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")
		(List	(Concept "Ben") (Concept "animal"))))

; We can also verify that Ben isn't foobar'ed.
(cog-evaluate!
	(Evaluation
		(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")
		(List	(Concept "Ben") (Concept "foobar"))))

; ----------
; The above demos all used the EvaluationLink, which, by defintion,
; will always return a TruthValue.  By contrast, the ExecutionOutput
; link behaves similarly, except that it can return general Values or
; even Atoms. Of course, in this demo, it returns the same
; SimpleTruthValue as before, because that is what the PresentLink
; returns.
;
; Note some differences: we use cog-execute! here, not cog-evaluate!
(cog-execute!
	(ExecutionOutput
		(Lambda
			(VariableList (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))
			(Present (Inheritance (Variable "this") (Variable "that"))))
		(List	(Concept "mammal") (Concept "vertebrate"))))

; ExecutionOutput was designed to work with DefinedSchema, not
; DefinedPredicate. But otherwise, the same ideas apply. (Schemas
; can return Atoms; Predicates only return TruthValues.)

; That's All Folks!  The End!
