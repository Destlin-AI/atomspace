; vector-column.scm -- Pack floating point data into vectors.
;
; The AtomSpace is designed to store arbitrary hypegraphs of any
; shape. When storing data from natural sources, such as biological
; (genomic, proteomic) data, natural language data, and web data,
; such networks are commonly scale-free, and the corresponding
; adjacency matrix is extremely sparse. (That is, the number of
; non-zero elements in the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix
; follow a Zipfian distribution. That is, 99.999% of them are zero.)
;
; However, modern theory and practice are oriented around non-sparse
; vectors that can be delivered to a GPU for rapid processing. Thus,
; a reasonable task is to perform a slice through the network graph,
; and deliver that slice to a GPU for further processing. That slice
; can be created using the QueryLink, illustrated in other examples.
; This demo shows how the results of the query can be turned into
; columns, suitable for numeric processing.
;
; Any query (QueryLink, MeetLink, etc.) can be thought of as defining
; an N-tensor, when it has N variables in the query. Thus, a query with
; one variable produces a vector of results. A query with two variables
; produces ... a single list of results, but the distinct values for
; each variable can be thought of as defining the indexes of a matrix.
; For three variables, a 3-tensor is formed.
;
; Tha's all well and fine, but query results typically stay in the
; AtomSpace. To be useful in compute applications, they need to be
; packaged up as vectors. This demo illustrates how this can be done.

(use-modules (opencog) (opencog exec))

; ------------------------------------------------------------
; Begin with a trivial case: serialize a list of numbers.

; Here's the list.
(define numli (List
	(NumberNode 1)
	(NumberNode 2)
	(NumberNode 3)
	(NumberNode 4)))

; The FloatColumn can be used to convert this list into a vector
(FloatColumn numli)

; It doesn't become a column until executed:
(define numvec (cog-execute! (FloatColumn numli)))

; Print it out:
(format #t "A vector of floating point numbers: ~A\n" numvec)

; Well, this is pretty boring, except for the fact that, under the
; covers, the FloatValue class is implemented in C++, using
; std::vector<double> to hold this numbers. The std::vector<T>::data()
; method provide a pointer to a raw list of doubles, which can be
; directly handed over to a compute platform for processing.

; ------------------------------------------------------------
; Most AtomSpace processing works with data held int FloatValue's
; and not NumberNodes.  This is as it should be: NumberNodes, since
; they are Nodes, are held directly in the AtomSpace, chewing up RAM
; in the process. Worse: almost all numbers are boring; it is utterly
; pointless to store them as Nodes in the AtomSpace.
;
; To avoid the overhead, the FloatValue is provided. Its small and fast.
; But, like all Values, it is also garbage-collected: once all references
; to it are gone, it disappears. Thus Values must *always* be attached
; to Atoms, if they are to stick around.  This means that working with
; them is a bit trickier: they have to be accessed indirectly, as a
; key->value lookup. The next part reviews how this is done.

; A LinkValue of floats.
(define floli (LinkValue
	(FloatValue 5)
	(FloatValue 6)
	(FloatValue 7)
	(FloatValue 8)))

; Attach that value to an Atom (an AnchorNode, here) using a key
; (a PredicateNode, here).
(cog-set-value! (Anchor "heavy") (Predicate "weight") floli)

; Define some Atomese, that, when executed, will retreive the LinkValue
; (using ValueOfLink) from the given well-known location (the anchor)
; and using the well-known key (the Predicate). After retreival, the
; FloatColumn flattens it all out into a single vector.
(define flocol
	(FloatColumn (ValueOf (Anchor "heavy") (Predicate "weight"))))

; Execute the above, and print the result.
(define flovec (cog-execute! flocol))
(format #t "The float vector is: ~A\n" flovec)

; ------------------------------------------------------------
; Now we dive directly into the deep end.
; This will get complicated, quick.

; Create some "real world" data. For this example, the data is
; extremely uniform: it could just be a plain-old SQL table or
; something. That misses the point, though: the AtomSpace is
; designed to hold extremely irregular data that cannot be captured in
; tables.  But, to aid understanding ... here's a table.
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "Paul") (Item "bit")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "bit") (Item "the")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "the") (Item "dog")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "dog") (Item "in")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "in") (Item "the")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "the") (Item "leg")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "leg") (Item "and")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "and") (Item "it")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "it") (Item "hurt")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "hurt") (Item "a")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "a") (Item "lot")))
(Edge (Predicate "word-pair") (List (Item "lot") (Item ".")))

; -------
; To make the demo realistic, we'll tag each item with some floating
; point data, a "weight" of some sort. Well generate this randomly.
;
; Here's our random-number generator. Each tie it's accessed, it spits
; out a new random number. Just one at a time, that's what the '1' is.
(cog-set-value!
	(Anchor "heavy") (Predicate "randgen") (RandomStream 1))

; We need to get a list of all Items in the AtomSpace. A MeetLink
; will do, for that purpose.
(define item-query
	(Meet
		(TypedVariable (Variable "$word") (Type 'ItemNode))
		(Present (Variable "$word"))))

; Run it.
(cog-execute! item-query)

; The result is cached under the query itself, using the query as the
; key. You can get it manually:
(cog-value item-query item-query)

; Or you can get it automatically:
(cog-execute! (ValueOf item-query item-query))

; Automatically is preferred.
; -------
; Now comes the first hard part. Well draw on the random number
; generator, and tag each item with a random number. (The random number
; generator is a stand-in for a "real compute process" generating
; "real weights".)

; The filter applies the rule to each item returned by the ValueOf
; The rule only accepts ItemNodes, and discard anything else.
; The StreamValueOf samples a single float from the random generator.
; The SetValue attaches that number to each item.
;
; Yes, you cn think of this as a complicated for-loop. That misses the
; point though: streams can be endless, they can be multi-threaded, so
; that the producer is in a different thread than the consumer, and so
; on. These are (in general) multi-threaded producer-consumer streams,
; which is why this seems complicated.

; Anyway, lets run it.
