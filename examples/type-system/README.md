Creating Custom Atom Types
==========================
The files here demonstrate how to define new custom Atom Types.

Projects making use of the AtomSpace often require that some new kind
of data to be represented that does not fit into the basic set of
predefined types. The example used here is chemistry, with the new types
consisting of chemical element names, molecular bonds types and
molecules.

The example is split into two parts: defining the new Atom Types, in
the `demo-types` directory, and examples of using them, in the `apps`
directory.

The Atom Types are defined in the `chem_types.script` file. This can be
freely edited to specify new types. Everything needed to use them are
autogenerated by the `CMakefile.txt`. This includes the scheme, Python
and OCaML bindings. The language bindings are in the form of modules:
just include the correct module, and the types become usable.

Just copy these files to your project, adjust the various file paths,
define the desired types, and build. That's all there's to it!
