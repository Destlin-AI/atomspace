; factorial.scm - compute the factorial function, recursively.
;
; This implements a classic textbook algorithm for computing the
; factorial. It defines the factorial function as `f(n) = n * f(n-1)`
; and using an if statement (conditional) to terminate recursion when
; `n` reaches 1.  This is tail-recursive: no stack in either C++ or
; in scheme (or in "Atomese") will increase in size.
;
; This is an imperfect demo: although it does show that classic
; recursive algorithms can be implemented in Atomese, this is not
; really recommended programming practice, for the following reasons:
;
;  * The AtomSpace is a database. Whatever atoms get created as a result
;    of the algorithm will continue to live in the AtomSpace,
;    indefinitely. Is this something you really want? Badly-written
;    algos risk filling the AtomSpace with junk nodes - be careful!
;
;  * Running algorithms in Atomese is slow. It's not intended to be
;    a high-performance numerical computing platform; it is meant to
;    be a general-purpose knowledge-representation and reasoning system.
;
;  * A better example of numerical computation in the AtomSpace is the
;    processing of Values. Values are inherently fleeting, and are much
;    more numerically-oriented. Other examples show how.

#! ----------
How fast is this? Well, its slowwwww, but still, you can find out:
Just cut-n-paste the below. It taks about 16 seconds on my cheap
Intel Celeron laptop.

(define nrep 5000)
(define start (get-internal-real-time))
(for-each
	(lambda (x)
		(cog-execute! (ExecutionOutput (DefinedSchema "factorial") (Number 100))))
	(iota nrep))
(define end (get-internal-real-time))

(define elapsed
	(exact->inexact
		(/ (- end start) internal-time-units-per-second)))

(format #t "Total run time=~A seconds.  Each call took ~A millisecs\n"
	elapsed (/ elapsed nrep))

Note that the run-time does not depend on the atomspace size:
Lets create half-a-million Atoms:
(for-each NumberNode (iota 500000))

and run the measurement again; there should be no change.

---- !#

; Also, lets take a look at the atomspace, after eecution:
(cog-report-counts)

; Notice the number of Atoms were created. Effectively, the code
; is creating a tree that is N levels high, and then evaluating
; that tree, producing one NumberNode, holding the result of the
; evaluation.

; The End! That's all, folks!
